### Description
Additional information about the variables, data and transformations used in the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

### Source Data
Data + Description can be found here [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)


### Data Set Information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

### Attribute Information
For each record in the dataset it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### Data conversion

1. The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
2. The measurements on the mean and standard deviation (i.e. signals containing the strings `mean` and `std`) were extracted for each measurement
3. The activity identifiers replaced with descriptive activity names 
4. The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names 
	- The initial `f` and `t` replaced with `frequencyDomain` and `timeDomain`
	- `Acc`, `Gyro`, `Mag`, `Freq`, `mean`, and `std` changed into `Accelerometer`, `Gyroscope`, `Magnitude`, `Frequency`, `Mean`, and `StandardDeviation'.
5. From the data set in step 4, the final data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
